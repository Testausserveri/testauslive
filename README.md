# Testauslive

The `testauslive-norttilive-2024` branch contains the version that was used for [Testauslive @ Norttilive 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIOuBWtcsEc). It includes the frontend and the OBS control script used by the host, to control the overlays.

Currently, `master` branch contains a refactored version of the frontend. See [PR #1](https://github.com/Testausserveri/testauslive/pull/1) for details.

Feel free to add your own Testausserveri-themed ThreeJS scene!
